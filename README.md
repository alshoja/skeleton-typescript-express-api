# Skeleton for an Express API written in Typescript

This is a skeleton repo for an nodejs Express API application written in Typescript. Please fork to use.

## Instructions

This application is designed to be run within Visual Studio Code.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Open Visual Studio at the root.
3. Build by using `Ctrl+Shift+B` on Windows. 
5. Run by using `F5`. This will start an API on localhost using the port set in the `dev.env` file. 

NB: Building the project will run the tests. Run `npm run test` to just run the tests.
